# Swapno
My university project

To successfully lunch this, it requirs Glassfish server. 
it has glassfish-resources.xml so jdbc resources and connection pool will be created on the fly. 
just need to have a emty schema in Mysql database name swapno. 


for inputing items have to use following url
http://localhost:8080/Swapno/admin/viewProducts

initialy no product will be lodaed. i have plan for auto generating data which i will do if i got time. 

thanks
